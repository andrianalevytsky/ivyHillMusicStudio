        <strong>The Ivy Hill Music Studio</strong> was founded in the spring of
        2003, with the aim of providing quality musical education and training
        for children, teens and adults in the Ivy Hill area. The Studio offers
        individual lessons in keyboard and voice.<br />
        <br />
        Most of our students do indeed live in the neighborhood. Parents and
        grandparents often tell us how pleased they are to have music lessons
        available nearby, eliminating the need for complicated transport
        arrangements. In fact, some of our children walk to and from lessons
        after school on their own.<br />
        <br />
        Besides these neighborhood students, we also have people from the
        greater Vailsburg area, South Orange, Irvington, Maplewood, Union and
        even as far away as Denville.<br />
        <br />
        The Ivy Hill Music Studio offers a number of performance opportunities
        for its students. These include the annual spring recital, piano and
        voice parties where students perform for each other, and open lessons in
        which a student can perform a little program for invited friends and
        family members. Various neighborhood events provide further
        possibilities to perform and entertain.<br />
        <br />
        Tatiana Hrynyszyn, founder and director of the Ivy Hill Music Studio,
        has been a resident of the Ivy Hill area since 1987. She holds a
        Bachelor of Music Degree in Piano and Music Education from the Eastman
        School of Music at the University of Rochester, as well as a Master of
        Arts in Voice from Brooklyn College, City University of New York. She is
        certified to teach music in the New Jersey public schools. Tatiana is
        also a member in good standing of the Music Educators Association of New
        Jersey and the Ukrainian Music Institute of America.<br />
